The Domingo Cipher is an algorithm that encrypts and decrypts messages with its own cipher. This is developed in C programming language, and provides a multi-layered encryption on a plaintext so that it is difficult to decipher. It uses a combination of various ciphers, including Atbash Cipher, Ceasar Shift Cipher, Vigenere Cipher, Transposition Cipher, Vernam Cipher, and Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA). There is also some modifications, such as swapping or shifting letters other than the ciphers included. It is designed to take any alphanumeric string so as it does not exceed 200 characters as its input, though this limit is easily modifiable. Whitespaces and punctuation marks are allowed as input and preserved in the original message.
